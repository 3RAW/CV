 <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#000099">In 2015 I started to fundraise for a charity called Actionaid. It helps children in less privileged areas of the world like cambodia. I sponsored a child in Myanmar and started raising money by selling lollipops and an old bike which was too small for me. People donated money and plus, a corporate sponsorship gave us £300, so in total we raised £625!
