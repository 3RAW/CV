I sponsored a child in Myanmar and started raising money by selling lollipops and an old bike which was too small for me. People donated money and plus, a corporate sponsorship gave us £300, so in total we raised £625!

  <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#000099">When I was 8, I had an idea to make the school magazine as they had stopped making them last year. I interviewed a couple of fellow students about what they thought about the school and even the new head master who had recently joined the school. I put together the information, along with a comic made by my sister, a trick to learn your times tables and lots more! The following year I made the second edition of Hello Belmont. You can read my first issue <a href="hello belmont Issue 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and my second issue <a href="hello belmont 2.pdf" target="_blank">here!</font></p></center>
