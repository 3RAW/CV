  <center><h2>Actionaid</h2></center>

 <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#000099">In 2015 I started to fundraise for a charity called Actionaid. It helps children in less privileged areas of the world like cambodia. I sponsored a child in Myanmar and started raising money by selling lollipops and an old bike which was too small for me. People donated money and plus, a corporate sponsorship gave us £300, so in total we raised £625!

  <center><h2>Hello Belmont</h2></center>
  <center><img src="Hello Belmont logo.jpg" alt="Hello0 Belmont" width="320" height="75"></center>
  <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#339933">When I was 8, I had an idea to make the school magazine as they had stopped making them last year. I interviewed a couple of fellow students about what they thought about the school and even the new head master who had recently joined the school. I put together the information, along with a comic made by my sister, a trick to learn your times tables and lots more! The following year I made the second edition of Hello Belmont. You can read my first issue <a href="hello belmont Issue 1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and my second issue <a href="hello belmont 2.pdf" target="_blank">here!</a></font></p></center>
  <center><h2>Blue Peter</h2></center>
  <center><img src="Blue-Peter-green-badge.png" alt="Hello0 Belmont" width="175" height="100"></center>
  <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#800000">In Year 3, I looked up to another girl in my class who had already received a Blue Peter Badge. I looked at the different types of badges and settled on the green one with the theme as nature. I wrote a poem about caring and loving plants. After a long wait I finally got a letter. I opened it eagerly and to my astonishment a little green badge lay in the envelope. Here is my poem:</font></p></center>

  <center><h2>Mini Medals</h2></center>
   <center><img src="IMG_0467.JPG" alt="Medals" width="175" height="125"></center>
  <center><p><font face="verdana" color="#FF6600">When I was on my skiing holiday, I thought that maybe just like I got a badge in skiing, maybe I could get the same thing for rewarding brilliant behaviour. So, when I got back home in London, my family got to work and each designed two medal designs. We put them into a CAD program and my dad turned the design into a medal. We polished the silver finishes so they shined. Finally, my mum, a graphic designer, created the website and the logo.
